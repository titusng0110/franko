# 27. Runtime and Backend Notes

The current compiler targets C++14.

Some Franko rules mirror the generated C++ representation, especially array behavior.

For example, array `memcpy` is designed to support combinations such as:

```text
Static<T, N>.memcpy(Static<T, M>)
Static<T, N>.memcpy(Dynamic<T>)
Dynamic<T>.memcpy(Dynamic<T>)
Dynamic<T>.memcpy(Static<T, M>)
```

Static array sizes must be greater than zero because generated C++ uses fixed-size arrays, and zero-length C++ arrays are not standard.

Function signatures are registered before function bodies are analyzed so that forward references, direct recursion, and mutual recursion can be resolved.

Global variable declarations are also registered before function bodies are analyzed, so functions can reference globals declared later in source order.

Array initializer lists are lowered before ordinary semantic checking.

For example:

```franko
xs = [1, 2, 3];
```

is lowered to:

```franko
xs[0] = 1;
xs[1] = 2;
xs[2] = 3;
```

Nested initializer lists are lowered recursively.

The backend does not need to implement initializer lists as runtime values because they are not values in Franko.
